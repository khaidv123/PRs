This adds a new way to handle the daily catch limit. It will disable the
catch tasks just like we ran out of balls. It will disable all catch
tasks for an hour, after that it will check if the amount of catches is
lower than the limit and resume catching if so.
During the hour we still check if the amount of Pokemon caught is lower
than the daily limit minus 20, if so the bot will resume catching again,
ending the remaining wait time.
Notice if we enabled ""exit_on_limit_reached"", the bot will still exit if
the daily limit is reached!!"

Pokemon Hunter - Mobster and Trash Hunter"

In this version of the Pokemon Hunter, we can select if we want to hunt
down family members of VIPs (Like a mobster) and if we want to hunt for
certain ""trash"" Pokemon.

Mobster
When setting ""target_family_of_vip""to true, the Hunter will also mark
family of the VIPs you set as a valid target.
If you have ""lock_on"" enabled, and want to be sure you catch every last
family member of the VIPs, you can enable ""treat_family_of_vip_as_vip"".
This effectively means that the whole family of a VIP needs to be hunted
down as VIP Pokemons.

Trash Hunting
Trash hunting will trigger when a set amount of space is left in the
bag. If triggered, the Hunter will start hunting down Caterpies, Weedles
and Pidgeys. These only take 12 candy to evolve, so are useful for mass
evolving.

If a VIP Pokemon is detected nearby while hunting for trash, the Hunter
will change the target to the VIP (and locking onto it if enabled)"

When starting up the bot, if the sniper feed has 0 items in it, it disables sniping for the rest of the session. This might make sense on the surface for something like a RocketMap feed, where there should always be at least something, but when using a custom feed with only amazing spawns, it's often empty. This isn't a problem - the sniper loops through all items in the feed, which in this case is zero, then moves on. Actual problems with the feed (404, invalid JSON, etc) will trigger a separate error. 

I've tested this with a valid feed with items, a valid feed with zero items, and invalid feeds - all work as expected."

- Picks a random Pokemon to hunt down. More human like behaviour
- Lists Pokemon around with number instead of repeatedly in a list
- If unable to move to a hunted Pokemon, abort the search and start a cooldown

If we have no pokeballs left, abandon the lure (to move to a fort to get
more pokeballs) when we got some pokeballs again, will move back to the
lure.

* Moved check down, added announce once

As suggested, moved the check a bit down
Solved the message spam with a switch to announce or not

* Adjusted code based on advise by Anakin5

Now the worker will set a time to walk away from the lures.
After the time has passed, the worker will check again if we have some
Pokeballs. If we have enough, we will search for a lure again (the old
one could be finished)

* Fixed not running if had more item than inventory size (#3531)

* Added to the inventory class the necessary to keep trace of items

* Now using the new inventory class properly

* Decoupled when to recycle an item from how to do it.

* Moved the recycler in the services folder

* remove Debian python-protobuf dependency (#3670)

- during installation of pgoapi, protobuf will automatically be a
dependency (confirmed with `pip show pgoapi`)

- Even for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, python-protobuf version is
2.6.1-1.3, which is too old
  + confirmed with `apt-cache show python-protobuf`
  + see issue #1815
  (https://github.com/PokemonGoF/PokemonGo-Bot/issues/1815)

* First basic features of the pokemon optimizer (#2956)

* catching every single pokemon nearby

* catch lured pokemon in all forts nearby

* adding run_interval to some tasks to avoid running all the time and minimum tick time of 5 seconds

Tasks inheriting from BaseTask should use `self._update_last_ran` and
`_time_to_run` if they want to implement the time based running. The
config to set a custom timer is named `run_interval`.

* added config to ignore item count for Spin and MoveToFort

this works good with the `run_interval` configuration added to
TransferPokemon and RecycleItem

* spinning all pokestops in range

- Keep enough candies for consecutive evolutions of best pokemons
- Only evolve the lowest rank of a family

* Add lucky egg support when enough pokemon to evolve

* fixing returns

* - Support Eevee evolution scheme
- Rename ""use_lucky_egg"" parameter in the more accurate ""evolve_only_with_lucky_egg""

* Merge cells together to avoid staying in one cell too long

This should help mitigate the issue where the bot travels to a stop
that is farther than a nearby one because the nearer one is in another
cell.

I also release control back to the make loop after catching any pokemon.

* PR Feedback fixes

+ Add concatenation of nearby cells rather than override.

Previously, the location_cache can't be used, even people set location_cache to TRUE. Everytime, it starts from the initial position.

Now the bot check the initial position first. 
Then check if people set location_cache. If so, read it and update it, otherwise use the initial location.
If there is no initial location and no location cache, print msg and exit.

* Default conf value and fixed typo

* fixed typo for pokemon and updated config
* added default value if its missing from conf

NOTE: transfer conditions are set by ""release"" parameters in config,
however we keep the highest CP of each pokemon, just to be sure we don't
empty the bag.

* missed to rename on some places

Also enabled loggning to easier see why a certain pokemon may not be
transfered to professor for candy

* moved runtime error to evolved_capture statement

workaround if anyone should get it...

fixing it in future

* Anonymous login succ/failed/relogin/logout info to GA. (#1312)

* There's a big warning before bot login and 2s wait for exit if the health report is turned on.
Anonymous login succ/failed/relogin/logout info without any user account info will be sent to GA.
The function is not called to wait Signal system merge.

* Fix for clash between CLI and JSON args (#1420)

* makes spin forts and catch pokemon config in json not being overwritten by default cli args value if user dont provide cli args

* huge fix to how cli and json parameters are loaded

The CLI parameter parser now uses JSON-loaded parameters as first
fallback to missing parameters. The second fallback to missing
parameters are the default values previously used.

This is the perfect handling for making CLI args override JSON
configuration only for provided args. Non-provided args that are not
found in are set to the default value we think most users are going to
like.

* Warns if there aren't sufficient space left for loot.

SpinFort will terminate silently, and users will not notice
that SpinFort is skipping due to the lack of space.

As a result, it sends out requests to Niantic even faster than before
becuase tasks are looping faster and doing noops. More server busy (error 52)
errors appear in the log without an explanation of what's actually
going on.
